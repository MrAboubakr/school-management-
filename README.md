# school-management app :
This app serves as the frontend of a project that manages various aspects of a school, focusing on student needs. The backend part of the project hasn't been published on my GitHub yet.

To understand more about how the app works in the background, take a look at api.js. This file contains all open endpoints to interact with the server-side. You have the flexibility to change, add, or customize endpoints as needed.

I've only utilized the React testing part of the project so far. There's no security login or authorization implemented yet. The project is open for further development and enhancements. Feel free to add anything you think would improve it. Completing this project will be a great achievement. Enjoy working on it!
